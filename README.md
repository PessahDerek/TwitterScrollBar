# TwitterScrollBar
This is a very tiny chrome extension that hides the scrollbar on twitter web on pc that is on the left panel where icons are placed and also beautifies the main scrollbar on the right a little. Its a harmless scrollbar, really, but useless at the same time and messes with the UI a lot. At least for me.
